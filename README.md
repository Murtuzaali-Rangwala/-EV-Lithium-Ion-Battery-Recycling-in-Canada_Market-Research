EV Lithium Ion Battery Recycling in Canada_Market-Research 

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
This exploratory market research project analyzes Canada's emerging EV battery recycling market. The analysis covers:
- Market sizing and forecast (93,000 batteries by 2040)
- Current infrastructure status (1 commercial + 1 pilot facility)
- Scenario modeling (metal recovery potential)
- Regulatory gaps (no national EPR framework)
- Supply-chain mapping and recommendations

All data is sourced from 10 verified, peer-reviewed, and government sources with complete APA 7 citations.

FILES INCLUDED
--------------
1. EV.pdf
2. EV.xlsx
3. EV BATTERY RECYCLING IN CANADA.pptx

KEY FINDINGS
------------
MARKET SIZE: 93,000 EV batteries will need recycling by 2040; 500,000 by 2045 (Lark Scientific, 2025)

INFRASTRUCTURE GAP: Only 1 commercial facility (Lithion Technologies, Quebec) + 1 pilot (Electra Battery Materials, Ontario). No national EPR framework exists (Compliance and Risks, 2025).

CAPACITY CRISIS: Current capacity will be exhausted by 2034–2038 without new investment (UBC Open Library, 2022).

METAL RECOVERY POTENTIAL: Single 10,000-tonne/year facility recovers:
• Lithium: 128 tonnes 
• Nickel: 1,282 tonnes
• Cobalt: 523 tonnes
• Manganese: 900 tonnes
• Total: 2,833 tonnes metals annually
• CO₂ avoided: 15,000 tonnes/year

REGULATORY FRAGMENTATION: Ontario excludes EV batteries from EPR; BC paused program integration; no federal framework (Compliance and Risks, 2025).

RECOMMENDATIONS: 5 priorities including national EPR, regional hubs, technology adoption, collection networks.

METHODOLOGY
-----------
1. Market Research: Identified 10 credible sources (government reports, peer-reviewed studies, industry analysis)
2. Data Verification: Cross-checked all claims against primary sources
